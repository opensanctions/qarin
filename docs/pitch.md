# What is Qarin?

We want to make open source tools for matching the names of humans and companies across various data streams.

## Why? 

Motivating use case is **sanctions screening**: is the company I'm about to sell micro-controllers to involved in making tanks in Russia?

[OpenSanctions.org](https://opensanctions.org/) builds an open-source database of international military and economic sanctions. We also map out other companies and people with an increased risk profile. Our data is free for non-commercial use, and available for commercial subscriptions.

## How?

## Can I get involved?

Yes please! We're going to work out in the open, in this repository (`github.com/opensanctions/qarin`).
