# What is Qarin?

We want to make open source tools for matching the names of humans and companies across various data streams.

## Why? 

* [OpenSanctions.org](https://opensanctions.org/) builds an open-source database of international military and economic sanctions. We also map out other companies and people with an increased risk profile.
* Our data is free for non-commercial use, and available for commercial subscriptions.
* Motivating use case is **sanctions screening**: is the company I'm about to sell micro-controllers to involved in making tanks in Russia?
* State of the Art is often deeply broken and discriminatory methods for screening. Can we do better?

## How?

We will proceed in roughly three steps:
- Create a **test dataset** of names, and a **benchmarking suite** for evaluating matching algorithms and displaying results.
- We're going to build a **machine learning suite** for matching names, and a **command-line tool** for running it.

## Can I get involved?

Yes please! We're going to work out in the open, in this repository (`github.com/opensanctions/qarin`).
